# W3 Assignment — Machine Learning Pipeline and Evaluation

This project is part of the Week 3 assignment for the AI / Machine Learning bootcamp.
The goal is to explore preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation techniques on tabular data.

## Objectives
- Encode categorical features (Ordinal, One-Hot)
- Build pipelines with different models
- Compare against baseline Dummy models
- Use cross-validation, validation curves, and learning curves
- Tune hyperparameters and evaluate on a test set

## Models
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVC)
- HistGradientBoostingClassifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (Regressor)
- DummyClassifier
